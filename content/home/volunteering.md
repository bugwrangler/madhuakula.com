Code Vigilant project is created out of the need to have a more secure open source software. It is a known fact that a large number of users use opensource software but a very few of them contribute back in terms of identifying and making these opensource software a more secure piece of software.

This project is initiated with an aim of finding flaws in open source software and making sure that we reach one of the following conclusion.

1. Get the vulnerability fixed and Patch issued.
2. If author is not reachable then make sure the public information is available and spread the details that issues exist with opensource software and discourage its usage.

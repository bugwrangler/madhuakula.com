By collecting logs from various sources we will monitor and analyse the attacks. Using data gleaned from the logs, we can apply defensive rules against the attackers. We will be using open source technologies to build this monitoring solution.\n\nTraining attendees will receive a comprehensive walk-through E-book, Ansible Playbooks, custom scripts and best practices check-lists.\n","tags":null,"title":"Automated infrastructure security monitoring and defence","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1486751400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554741004,"objectID":"11ea1607e22bd66da14ce7fbcad3ab06","permalink":"/talk/null-bangalore-puliya-feb-2017/","publishdate":"2017-02-11T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/null-bangalore-puliya-feb-2017/","section":"talk","summary":"Most of us are excellent at doing things, but when it comes to documentation it's one of the boring tasks ever in life.
